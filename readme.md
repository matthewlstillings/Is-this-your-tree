# Is this your tree?

A web app that uses tree characteristics to help students identify trees in and around Central Park.

# Motivation

While I was studying wildlife biology, one of my classes focused on the identification of woody plants. Beyond just memorizing them all, part of the class is using the characteristics as clues to get down to the right species using a guide. The “guide” frankly was clunky to use and as one can imagine absolutely massive. (Not exactly the best for long hikes). 

I started teaching myself programming on the side and while I was chatting with my professor she has asked if I could build an application that students could use in helping identify trees.
